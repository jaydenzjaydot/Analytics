# 🛍️ Customer Behaviour Analysis — SQL & Python

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to analyze customer behaviour by combining SQL for data extraction and transformation with Python for data analysis and visualization.  
It’s designed to help businesses understand customer purchasing trends, preferences, and patterns to improve decision‑making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Extract customer sales and transaction data from a SQL database.  
- Clean, transform, and prepare data using SQL queries and Python (Pandas & NumPy).  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.  
- Create visual reports and dashboards for key business insights.
